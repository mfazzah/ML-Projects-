# ML-Projects

## ML Projects
*Description:* Collection of machine learning projects done to learn more about ML principles. Description for each folder follows:
* DecisionTrees: The decision tree ID3 algorithm is used to train the dataset, and draw the final decision tree.
* NaiveBayes: Implementation of the Naive Bayes document classifier as applied to the newsgroups dataset. Overall testing accuracy is reported, and the performance of the testing set is used to gauge the effect of a prior, 	Î±. 
* LogisticRegression:  Predicts income from census data using logistic regression. Specifically, the model predicts the probability that a person earns more than $50k per year. Initially, the model considers all features, and then the model is tuned to extract the best features and raise the overall accuracy.
